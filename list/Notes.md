# Linked List
Looking for new implementations that are more efficient, clever or simply better.  

- Double pointers
- Optional tail pointer
- Optional Cache
- Memory pool instead of random assignment in heap

- [Basic Linked List](https://towardsdatascience.com/linked-list-implementation-guide-16ed67be18e4): Don't like the pointer args, this requires the caller to reassign rather than simply calling the function.

- [Problems on Lists](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/105/LinkedListProblems.pdf): Can maybe try out a few interesting ones when I'm done with the implementation.
